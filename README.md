## Lessons Learned


As a team we faced a few hurdles and we overcame them and in the process learned valuable lessons. The most notable of these challenges we faced were the merging of two independent minds to come up with a single solution, in other words collaboration. We learned through trial and error, extended communication and through resources provided by Alx, on how to successfully collaborate and to eventually bring this project to fruition.
